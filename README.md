# GUI Zip Cracker

A python project using libraries: threading,pyzipper,tkinter,os and time. 
This Zip Cracker helps cracking protected zips for users who don't like to interact with OS terminal.


## How it works?

This project implements threading, which is calculated with os.cpu_count,I always reccomend checking threads by yourself, some processors or architectures might not show the thread count.

Using threading this Zip Cracker can be used in any system,if you select a higher thread ammount,it will use more threads to crack the password, which might result in a faster cracking. 

For those who want to use it in a specific computer, you can specify a fixed thread ammount.
